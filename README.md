# 🚀 100 Days of Buildables

Welcome to my 100 Days of Buildables journey!

This repository is a collection of tasks, experiments, and projects I’m working on as part of the Buildables Fellowship. The main focus is on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with the goal of building practical, real-world solutions.

## 🌟 What’s Inside?

📂 Well-structured Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)

🧠 Hands-on ML & DL projects

📊 Data preprocessing, visualization & model building 

🚀 Deployable solutions and experiments

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

To run the notebooks locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AqsaNajeeb/100DaysOfBuildables

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd 100DaysOfBuildables

3. Install the dependencies (as needed per notebook):
   ```sh
   pip install package_name

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
