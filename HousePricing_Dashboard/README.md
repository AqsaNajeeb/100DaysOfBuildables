# 🚀 100 Days of Buildables – Streamlit App

Welcome to my **100 Days of Buildables** journey!  

This folder contains one of my practical tasks: building and deploying a **Streamlit app** for data understanding, visualization, and modeling.  

The main focus of this task is **House Pricing Analysis** 🏡, where I explore, clean, visualize, and model datasets interactively.

## 🌟 What’s Inside?

📂 Streamlit app (`app.py`) for interactive dashboards  
🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing (missing values, summaries)  
📊 Built-in visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, bar charts, heatmaps)  
⚡ Regression & Classification models (using Random Forest)  
☁️ Deployment-ready on Streamlit Cloud
